# 🔐 Cloud Security Analysis

A collaborative research project focused on evaluating and testing cloud infrastructure security using AWS and GCP. Our team performed penetration testing techniques including ARP spoofing and NMAP vulnerability scans to explore real-world vulnerabilities and assess built-in cloud protections.

## 📘 Overview

This project was developed as part of our coursework at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM), targeting:

- Shared Responsibility Model awareness
- Detection and prevention of ARP Spoofing
- Testing with NMAP scripts for vulnerability scanning
- Comparative analysis of AWS and GCP security tools
- Evaluation of features like VPCs, IAM policies, WAFs, Shield, GuardDuty, and more

## 🧪 Testing Techniques

- 🔍 **ARP Spoofing**: Simulated MITM attacks to examine the network segmentation and protections
- 🔧 **NMAP Scanning**: Used various scripts and scan modes to discover vulnerabilities and OS information
- 📊 **Case Studies**: Reviewed real-world breaches like Equifax and Home Depot to understand how they could have been mitigated with modern cloud practices
